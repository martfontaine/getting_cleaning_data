run_analysis.R
=====================

The script run_analysis.R contains executable code. Just select all and execute. It will download the data (you can skip this if you did that already), reads the data and selects the appropriate collumns and enriches it with the lables and subjects. In the end a tidy data.txt file is created with the tidy data set.
